You can find the tutorial on hashnode, [here](https://hashnode.com/post/building-a-nodejs-api-with-typescript-and-graphql-cjrrojjx200uqrxs1ngtitx9p)

### Getting started

- Run in development mode with hot reloading `npm run dev`

- Build `npm run build`

- Generate types and schemas `npm run generate-typedefs`. do this after changes to the api to keep the types in sync.
